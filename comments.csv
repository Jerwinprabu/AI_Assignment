I love how detailed the art is in manhwa!
Manga is much better; manhwa feels slow.
Both are unique in their own way!
Manhwa stories are usually repetitive and boring.
"This webtoon is amazing, can't wait for the next chapter!"
The storyline is getting boring now.
I really enjoyed the character development!
"The plot is confusing, I don’t understand what’s happening."
"Wow, what an emotional rollercoaster."
"The artwork is stunning, one of the best I’ve seen."
"I didn’t like the ending, it felt rushed."
"It’s good, but I think it could be better with more action scenes."
"The humor in this manhwa is top-notch, made me laugh out loud!"
I hate how slow the updates are.
One of the best webtoons I've ever read!
