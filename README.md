Task Details:

Task 1:
•
Create a simple content classifier using “Top 15 Anime And K-Drama Like True Beauty 
Webtoon” as inspiration. Develop a basic script that classifies webtoon descriptions into
categories (e.g., romance, action, fantasy) using Python and scikit-learn.

You can use a small dataset of 10-15 webtoon descriptions.
Implement a basic model (e.g., decision tree or logistic regression) to classify the
categories and show the output.
